<p>Hello, and welcome to the first Elite Puzzle Hunt, written by Eliters, for Eliters!</p>

<p>The hunt took place between 9pm January 3rd and 11:59pm January 10th, 2010.
Congratulations to <strong>Domination Station</strong> (<em>cyberwrath</em> and
<em>Discombobulator</em>) for winning the inaugural hunt.</p>

<p>Although the hunt has now been completed, both the site and puzzles remain
for all to browse. No team/user registration is required to try the puzzles, although
your puzzle status can no longer be tracked. Be sure to check out the solutions if
you get stuck!</p>
