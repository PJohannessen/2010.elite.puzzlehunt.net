<span style="font-size: 18px;">Man of the World (SOLUTION)</span><br/>
Author: Cyberwrath<br/>
Difficulty: Easy
<br/><br/>

<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the countries is not enough. Try going a little deeper.
<li>Not sure how to continue? Try to brainstorm a capital idea with your teammate.
<li>5 countries, 5 capital cities. Use the numbers as indices, then cap it off again.
</ol>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> VALLETTA
<br><br>

Upon first glance, you should hopefully notice this man's face (and shirt) are comprised of flags from all over the globe. The clue is hinting you might want to try finding the CAPitals of these countries next. Then, use the number on the flag to index into the capital's name. The indexed letters are A-M-T-A-L, which you can anagram to the country MALTA. Find the capital as you did with the other 5 countries to discover the answer, <strong>VALLETTA</strong>.
<br><br>
(Note: It seems there is a bit of confusion on what the true capital of Palau is. Most resources say Melekeok, but at the time the hunt was run, Wikipedia temporarily had changed the capital on the Palau page to Ngerulmud, though it has since been changed back. We apologize for the confusion this had caused some teams.)
