Author: Infil<br/>
Difficulty: Hard
<br/><br/>

<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>It's safe to proceed, Rick Astley does not make an appearance in this puzzle.
<li>What "unique" element is spoken at each given timestamp?
<li>Take the advice of the lone commenter on the final video!
</ol>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> CHOCOLATERAIN
<br><br>

Those who surf the internet often shouldn't take too long to recognize a bizarre sequence of alphanumeric characters as a potential Youtube URL, especially when coupled with notation that looks like a timestamp. The title, referencing the famous video "The Evolution of Dance", should also help clue you. 

<br><br>

Open each Youtube video and listen to what is said in the video at the given timestamp. If you listen closely, you should be able to pick out a character which is valid in another Youtube URL. The "Only 2nd and 6th big" line prompts you to capitalize the letters in the 2nd and 6th positions, as Youtube URLs are case-sensitive. Listed below are the characters you should have heard at each timestamp.<br><br>

{#2 1:59}: 5 (...sorts of sits there between <strong>five</strong> and seven...)<br>
{#3 0:12}: O (...<strong>Oh</strong> Canada...)<br>
{#1 2:37}: - (...quick spun knuckle, focus attack <strong>dash</strong> cancel...)<br>
{#5 0:19}: m (...keep it up, and you'll earn those <strong>M</strong>s...)<br>
{#2 1:07}: 6 (...and singing a tune about <strong>six</strong>...)<br>
{#8 0:19}: E (...furthermore, the equation <strong>E</strong> is equal to...)<br>
{#6 0:39}: m (...feminist women love <strong>Em</strong>inem...)<br>
{#7 2:20}: 6 (...<strong>six</strong>-six-six, the number of the beast...)<br>
{#9 2:55}: 2 (...times one, times <strong>two</strong>, tiiiimes three...)<br>
{#10 1:01}: 1 (...it's as easy as one, two, three. Step <strong>one</strong>...)<br>
{#4 0:09}: o (...<strong>Oh</strong> say can you see...)

<br/><br/>

This directs you to the final <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O-m6Em621o">Youtube video</a>, which shows Infil on his couch talking about the puzzle to the camera. Throughout the video, random annotations are displayed, which may strike you as a little odd at first. In particular, at around the 1:16 mark, an abnormally large annotation is displayed. If you turn off annotations, you will see a cue card is hidden behind this huge block of text. Turning off annotations is also clued by the lone user who made a comment on the video, saying the annotations are annoying and should be turned off. Written on the cue card is the URL for "Chocolate Rain" by Tay Zonday, one of the more famous Youtube videos ever produced. The answer to this puzzle is <strong>CHOCOLATERAIN</strong>.
