<span style="font-size: 18px;">Une Fa&ccedil;on de Cacher les Secrets Fran&ccedil;ais (SOLUTION)</span><br/>
Author: Infil<br/>
Difficulty: Hard
<br/><br/>

<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>With modern technology, this "chiffre" is no longer "indechiffrable".
<li>After identifying the French figure the famous cipher is named after, apply a series of chain reactions to make progress.
<li>After decrypting each line, what should be done with your last unused key?
</ol>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> RIJNDAEL
<br><br>

The puzzle's title is French for "One way to hide French secrets". Well, one way to hide French secrets is to use a famous cryptographic method attributed to a French figure, the Vigenere cipher. This method was well-studied and appears in any serious discussion of the history of cryptography (including Wikipedia's), and is the only historically relevant method given a French name. It was also once known as "le chiffre indechiffrable", which means "the unbreakable cipher", which the first clue references (Googling the word "indechiffrable" brings up many pages on the Vigenere cipher).<br><br>

The cipher encodes plaintext using another textual key by repeating the key until it's as long as the plaintext, then "adding up" (and wrapping around) the letters. More specifically, if A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25, then enciphering a letter <i>x</i> with a key letter <i>y</i> is simply <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> (mod 26). Deciphering is done by "subtracting" the letters. Your first key, as referenced by the preamble, is "middleoftheroad". Decipher the first line using this key; doing it by hand is pretty time consuming, so just use some <a href="http://www.sharkysoft.com/misc/vigenere/">web tool</a> to do it. Take the answer from the first question and use it as the key to decipher the next line. The answers should fit in the blanks next to each question.<br><br>

Repeat this process until you decipher all the lines. The answer to the final question is not the puzzle's solution, but rather another key to deciphering the first letters of all the answers (indicated by the boxes around the first blank on each row). This decrypts to the phrase ANSWERISRIJNDAEL. The answer to the puzzle is <strong>RIJNDAEL</strong>, which is the cipher currently used as the Advanced Encryption Standard, and effectively the most secure private-key encryption method ever developed.<br><br>
