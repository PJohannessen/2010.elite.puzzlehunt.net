<strong>ANSWER:</strong> LUIGI
<br><br>

The title references the classic argument between console controllers versus keyboards as the preferred gaming control scheme, but also sets up the puzzle to contain elements of both Xbox gaming and a keyboard layout. The top table contains 26 pictures which reference Xbox 360 achievements, and the name (a.k.a. gamertag) of someone who has earned this achievement. There are various ways to identify what the achievement's name is. Xbox.com is one way, though you need a (free) account and is a bit more time-consuming unless you know what game the achievement is from already. With a bit of googling, you can find achievement-tracking sites such as <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com">True Achievements</a> where you can search for the user and browse his obtained achievements. I made sure to pick only users who were listed on TA's site, and did my best to pick users who had relatively few achievements so the search process wasn't so painful (which is why I had to leave QB and Snap off this list, sorry!).<br><br>

As you're identifying the achievements, you should begin to realize that there is one for every letter of the alphabet (the fact that there are 26 should also help). Each achievement matches with a square on the keyboard below, but which square? It's immediately clear that this isn't your standard QWERTY keyboard. Rather, the layout (blank squares are punctuation keys) matches up with the famous DVORAK keyboard, an alternate to QWERTY which never really took off.<br><br>

Once you match up the proper achievement to the key on the DVORAK layout, you can answer the questions on each key as they relate to the game the achievement is taken from. Reading across the first letters of the answers to each question gets the phrase ARRANGEQWERTYVIEWGAMERTAGS. So, take the achievements and reorder them according to the standard QWERTY layout, then read across the first letters of the gamertags. This spells the phrase FALCONJIGGLYPUFFNESSANDWHO, which reference the 4 hidden characters in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 64. The answer is <strong>LUIGI</strong>, the missing member from the list.
