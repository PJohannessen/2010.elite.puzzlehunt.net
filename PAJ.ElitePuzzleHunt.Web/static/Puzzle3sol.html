Author: Thiradell<br/>
Difficulty: Easy
<br/><br/>
<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Fannee Doolee must hate this puzzle... right?
<li>Back to front, not front to front.
<li>The double letters make a phrase.
</ol>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> TENNESSEE
<br><br>


The title of the puzzle, "Fannee Doolee," indicates we should be looking for double letters. However, there isn't a single word with double letters in the whole puzzle! Hmm...well, I do notice a lot of words that follow each other that start with the same letter. Look at the third line in particular: much more, rockier road, we were. However this doesn't quite work, considering the letters don't follow one another, and hence aren't really double letters.
<br><br>
But look again at rockier road. Not only does rockier start with R, it ends with R. rockieR Road...ah, now we're getting somewhere. It looks like the first occurrence of this is saW Winding, in the first line. If we go through the whole puzzle this way...
<br><br>
W - saW Winding<br>
H - oH Henry<br>
E - shE Even<br>
R - rockieR Road<br>
E - shE Ejaculated<br>
T - thoughT This<br>
H - oH Henry<br>
E - noticE Examining<br>
V - ganeV Very<br>
O - O Olivia<br>
L - abigaiL Lurking<br>
U - emU Under<br>
N - taN Nitwit<br>
T - aT That<br>
E - camE Eagerly<br>
E - thE Emu<br>
R - rogeR Rhinoceros<br>
S - silaS Snake<br>
P - philiP Panther<br>
L - lioneL Lion<br>
A - acaciA Are<br>
Y - lY You
<br><br>
We come up with the phrase WHERE THE VOLUNTEERS PLAY. The answer, and probably Fannee Doolee's favorite state, is <strong>TENNESSEE</strong>.
