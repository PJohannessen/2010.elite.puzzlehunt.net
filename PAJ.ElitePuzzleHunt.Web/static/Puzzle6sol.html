<span style="font-size: 18px;">Bizarre Form of Poetry (SOLUTION)</span><br/>
Author: Infil<br/>
Difficulty: Medium
<br/><br/>

<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ol>
<li>What style of poetry did Bruce Newling invent?
<li>Pay attention to the punctuation and capitalization if you need help ordering the lines.
<li>Answer the questions the 5 McWhirtles pose, then order according to the first line to discover your next instruction.
</ol>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> TRIPS
<br><br>

You're given a bunch of scattered lines which look like they belong to poems, but the structure is not immediately evident. The name Bruce Newling exists in the lines, and with a bit of research, you discover that he invented the McWhirtle, a 8-line poetry style derived from the double dactyl. Indeed, these 40 lines can be split up and reorganized to form 5 McWhirtles which ask 5 different questions. Reorganizing the lines can be done by noticing capitalization and punctuation patterns (capitalized lines start a stanza, lines ending with a period end one), as well as the meter of each line, the rhyming scheme, and the subject matter. The complete McWhirtles are listed below. Following the ordering instruction given at the top of the puzzle and answering each question gives the instruction "write elite mcwhirtle 2 infil".
<br><br>
You are to write a McWhirtle on an Elite theme and email it to Infil. The contact page is very clear about how to send email to Infil, and that all hunt queries should be emailed to him. Valid McWhirtles needed to follow the correct structure, which should be evident from the Wiki page and the fact that you have 5 example McWhirtles in front of you. The structure is:
<ul>
<li>The poem consists of 8 lines broken into two stanzas
<li>The last words of the two stanzas must rhyme
<li>There needs to be the name of a person (or group of people) on the second line of the first stanza
<li>The meter MUST follow the double-dactyllic structure, but you start each stanza with an unstressed syllable: da-DA-da-da-DA-da-da-DA-da-da... The last line of each stanza is shortened to end on a stressed syllable. There should be 23 syllables in each stanza.
</ul>
As the hunt wore on, I realized that people were having trouble understanding the structure, so I loosened these requirements a bit, and if the meter was off only by a little bit, I still accepted it (if it was way, way off though, I didn't). Note that the title of the poem follows the meter and could be considered the first line of a McWhirtle.<br><br>

Upon receiving a valid McWhirtle, your team was emailed a link to a page which contained the following double-dactyl:<br>

The time between the emailing of the poem and the viewing of the answer page was removed from the team's timer, so time spent waiting on Infil to verify the McWhirtle did not count against the team. The answer is <strong>TRIPS</strong>.

Here are the valid (or nearly valid in some cases) McWhirtles I received from the teams that solved this puzzle, in no particular order.
