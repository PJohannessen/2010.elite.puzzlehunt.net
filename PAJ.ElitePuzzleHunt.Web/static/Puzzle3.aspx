This was a strange place. I saw winding roads going in and out, going everywhere. "Oh, Henry!" said my wife; I had outrun her slightly. She even worked out for the past month trying to get in shape, but I was much more fit despite that. I halted on a rockier road than we were on before, and waited. After catching up, she ejaculated: "Wow, this road is rockier than the one we were on before." I thought this ironic and nearly laughed. "Oh Henry, this is a strange place." Here I chuckled several times, though quietly; she didn't notice. Examining the shoulder strap on her backpack, she said, "I wonder where they are." As chance would have it, I then espied Lyubomir Ganev, very quickly coming toward us, a smile on his face. "O Olivia!" he shouted, and she smiled. I frowned. Lyubomir had always had a crush on my wife. I noticed the sister of Lyubomir, Abigail, lurking close behind him. She was beautiful. "DID YOU NOTICE THAT EMU UNDER THE PORCH?!?!?" shouted a crazy man seated on the ground nearby. Trying to be humorous, I replied, "No sir! But a tan nitwit caught my eye!" He was very tan. Abigail was amused. "You are so childlike, Henry." At that moment an emu came eagerly sprinting out of the forest, which shocked every one of us. "There he is! Came out from under the porch, that rascal." The crazy man got up and likewise sprinted, hoping to catch the emu, I think. "Yesterday he told me his name was Roger Rhinoceros," mentioned Lyubomir, and everyone laughed. "Perhaps the day after today his name is going to be Silas Snake," said my wife, and Lyubomir laughed quite hard, to my disgust. "Philip Panther?" contributed Abigail, and I chortled; she was quite hilarious. I finished with "Lionel Lion," which was obvious to say, and we headed for their house. "This acacia are growing quite nice," said Abigail, and I chuckled; her English was rough. My wife said (using her shortened version of Lyubomir's name, which agitated me), "Ly, you have such a nice house here!" We went inside.
