<p>Hello, and welcome to the first Elite Puzzle Hunt, written by Eliters,
for Eliters! Be sure to check out the FAQ and Rules links to the left
if you have questions about how the hunt will be organized and run.</p>

<p>The start date for the hunt will be January 3rd, 2010 at some time
between 6pm and Midnight EST (will update with more info when we have it).
This time interval just lets us make sure everything is in order. Note
that, as per the rules, you don't necessarily have to be here the
instant the hunt starts to be competitive; in fact, if the time is too
late for you, you may choose to wait until the 4th to begin. It will
just be the time when the hunt is first made available to
competitiors, so don't worry too much about it.</p>

<p>Happy hunting!</p>
